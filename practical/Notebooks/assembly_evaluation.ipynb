    "But what if we are working with a new genome, one which has not been sequenced before? One approach is to look at k-mer distributions from the reads. This can be done using two pieces of software, `jellyfish` [(https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish)](https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish) and `Genomesope`. [(http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/)](http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/). Jellyfish is frst used to determine the distribution of k-mers in the dataset and then Genomescope is used to model the single copy k-mers as heterozygotes, while double copy k-mers will be the homozygous portions of the genome. It will also estimate the haploid genome size.\n",
