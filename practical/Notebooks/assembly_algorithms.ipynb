    "\n",
    "* **Overlap Layout Consensus (OLC):** This approach looks at all pairs x,y of all reads and determines if there is a sufficient overlap of the two reads. If there is, then it bundles the stretches of overlap graphs into contigs. Examples of assembly software that use this approach are Falcon (PacBio), Canu(Pacbio, ONT), mnimap/miniasm.\n",
